# My 3D Parallax Developer Portfolio 

<!-- ![3D Parallax Developer Portfolio Thumbnail](https://i.ibb.co/86NQD5c/thumbnail-3d-portfolio-smaller.jpg) -->

## Introduction
This portfolio is more than just a showcase of my work — it's a living journal of my journey as a software developer. Built with care and curiosity, it represents the milestones, late-night coding sessions, breakthroughs, and lessons learned that have shaped me into the developer I am today.

From the ground up, I constructed this portfolio using:

 - Vite for a blazing-fast, modern development environment
 - React for dynamic, component-driven interfaces
 - Tailwind CSS to craft responsive, elegant design
 - Three.js to bring immersive 3D elements to life
 - Framer Motion for meaningful, fluid animations
 - Hostinger to deploy and share my story with the world
 - GitHub for version control and continuous improvement

Each technology was chosen not just for functionality, but for how it helped me explore new concepts, push creative boundaries, and challenge myself to grow.

This project is a tribute — to the passion that drives me, the people who’ve mentored and believed in me, and the moments when I almost gave up but didn’t. I'm deeply grateful for the support I've received, whether in the form of feedback, encouragement, or a simple nudge in the right direction.

As I continue to evolve in this ever-changing field, I hope this portfolio will always remind me of where I started — and inspire others to keep building, keep learning, and stay curious.

Thank you for being part of this journey. ♥️
